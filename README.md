# Alpha Engine
Alpha Engine is a modular, C++ game engine designed to serve as a foundation for building 2D/3D games and interactive experiences. The engine is structured to support fast ECS runtime performance, a Unity-like level editor built with QT, and a range of essential tools â€” from physics simulation with Box2D to GUI using ImGui.

## Benchmark
Here is a comparison of perfomance of Unity and Alpha Engine when running a scene with a lot of asteroid entities. Each of them has components for rendering and running a small script to rotate them around a planet.
